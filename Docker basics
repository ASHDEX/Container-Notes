What Docker really is

Docker is:

A toolchain
A runtime
A packaging format
A developer UX layer
It makes kernel features usable by humans.

Docker architecture (important)
Docker CLI → what you type
Docker daemon → does the work
Container runtime → actually runs containers
Registry → image storage (Docker Hub)


Dockerfile = Build recipe
Analogy: Cooking instructions

A Dockerfile is not a container.
It’s a recipe:

FROM python:3.11
COPY app.py /app.py
CMD ["python", "/app.py"]

Deterministic
Layered
Cached
